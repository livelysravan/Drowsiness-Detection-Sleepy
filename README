Drowsiness Detection System 

Introduction
This report presents an overview and explanation of a Drowsiness Detection System implemented in Python using computer vision and sound processing libraries. The system is designed to detect signs of drowsiness in individuals based on facial landmarks.

Implementation Details

Libraries Used
imutils: A set of convenience functions for working with OpenCV and computer vision libraries.
dlib: A machine learning library providing tools for facial detection and landmark prediction.
cv2 (OpenCV): An open-source computer vision library.
pygame: A multimedia library used for playing sound.
System Components

Threshold Setting:
A threshold value (thres) is set to determine the level of drowsiness detection.

Pygame Initialization:
The Pygame mixer is initialized to handle sound playback.
A sound file (chippi.wav) is loaded to be played when drowsiness is detected.

Face Detection and Landmark Prediction:
The system uses the dlib library to detect faces in the webcam feed.
Facial landmarks are predicted using a pre-trained shape predictor model (shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat).

Drowsiness Detection Logic:
Specific facial landmarks for the left and right eyes are extracted.
Euclidean distances between these landmarks are used to calculate an average distance.
A history list (dlist) tracks the drowsiness detection results.
If the average distance is below the threshold for a certain number of consecutive frames, drowsiness is detected.

Sound Feedback:
When drowsiness is detected, the system plays a sound using Pygame.
If no drowsiness is detected, the system stops playing the sound.

imutils is a set of convenience functions to make working with OpenCV and other computer vision libraries easier.
dlib is a library for machine learning, including tools for facial detection and facial landmark prediction.
cv2 is the OpenCV library for computer vision.
pygame is a library for working with multimedia in Python, in this case, used for playing sound.
detector is a frontal face detector provided by dlib.
predictor is a shape predictor that predicts facial landmarks based on the detected face.
